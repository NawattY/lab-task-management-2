# REVIEW SCOPE

You must compare **THE PROMISE** against **THE REALITY**.

> **Naming:** Features use `<N>-<name>` format (e.g., `1-auth`, `2-payments`)

---

### THE PROMISE (Source of Truth)
1. `.project/features/<N>-<feature>/stories/<story>/STORY_SPEC.md` (Story scope)
2. `.project/SYSTEM_PRINCIPLES.md` (Coding Standards)

### THE REALITY (Implementation)
- Implemented source code
- Files mentioned in STORY_SPEC.md

---

**CRITICAL:** Even if code matches spec, IF it violates `SYSTEM_PRINCIPLES.md`, **IT IS A FAIL**.
